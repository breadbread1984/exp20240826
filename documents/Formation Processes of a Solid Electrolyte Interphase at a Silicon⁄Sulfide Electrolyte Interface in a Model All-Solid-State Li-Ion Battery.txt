Understanding the electrochemical reactions at the interface between a Si anode and a solid sulfide electrolyte is essential in improving the cycle stabilities of Si anodes in all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). Highly dense Si films with very low roughnesses of <1 nm were fabricated at room temperature via cathodic arc plasma deposition, which led to the formation of a Si/sulfide electrolyte model interface. Li (de)alloying through the model interface hardly occurred during the first cycle, whereas it proceeded stably in subsequent cycles. Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and neutron reflectometry directly revealed that the reduction or oxidation of the interfacial component or Li3PS4 electrolyte occurred during the first cycle. Consequently, an interfacial layer with a thickness of 13 nm and primarily composed of Li2S , SiS2 , and P2S5 glasses was formed during the first cycle. The interfacial layer acted as a Li-conductive, electron-insulating solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that provided reversible (de)lithiation. Our model interface directly demonstrates the electrochemical reaction processes at the Si/ Li3PS4 interface and provides insights into the structures and electrochemical properties of SEIs to activate the (de)lithiation of Si anodes using a sulfide electrolyte.
