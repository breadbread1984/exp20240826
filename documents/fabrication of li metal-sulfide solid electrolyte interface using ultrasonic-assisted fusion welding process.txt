To realize all-solid-state Li metal batteries, developing a technology that effectively joins Li metal with inorganic solid electrolytes is important. The ultrasonic- assisted fusion welding process, a novel process for joining Li metal and solid electrolytes, has the potential to offer advantages that cannot be obtained by the conventional pressing process of solid−solid joining because it uses molten Li. In this study, to investigate the applicability of this process to the joining of Li metal and sulfide solid electrolytes, amorphous Li3PS4 was used as an electrolyte, and the interface conditions and electrochemical properties were evaluated. Molten Li filled the roughness of the surface of the pelletized electrolyte, and the fabricated Li−Li3PS4 interface was in close contact without voids. Impedance analysis, SEM observations, and XPS depth profile analysis did not detect high-resistive layers. In the Li symmetric cells prepared by this process, electrochemical properties such as critical current density and repeated Li stripping/plating for 100 h were comparable or superior to the cells prepared by the conventional cold isostatic pressing process. Furthermore, this process achieved the joining of Li to the Li3PS4 thin-film sheet without a short circuit. Repeated charge− discharge cycles have been successfully demonstrated in the Li|Li3PS4|Li4Ti5O12 battery configuration.
