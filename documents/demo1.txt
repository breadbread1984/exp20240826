B3+ and In3+ ions were co-doped at the Al3+ sites of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 electrolyte using a solid- state reaction with the goal of obtaining electrolytes with remarkable Li-ion conductivities. B3+-ion doping enhanced the densification of Li1.3Al0.3-yByTi1.7(PO4)3 electrolytes, and Li1.3Al0.22B0.08Ti1.7(PO4)3 electrolyte delivered the highest relative density of 97.6. Subsequent In3+-ion doping further enhanced densification, and Li1.3Al0.21B0.08In0.01Ti1.7(PO4)3 electrolyte delivered the highest relative density of 98.2. However, the electrolyte densification diminished rapidly upon further increasing the In3+-ion content. The peaks in the X- ray diffraction patterns of the Li1.3Al0.3-yByTi1.7(PO4)3 and Li1.3Al0.22-xB0.08InxTi1.7(PO4)3 electrolytes were indexed to rhombohedral NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 with the space group R Ì„3c with trace amounts of LiTiPO5 secondary phase.
