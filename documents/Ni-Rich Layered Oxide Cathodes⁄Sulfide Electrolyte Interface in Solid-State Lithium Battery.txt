Because of the high specific capacity and low cost, Ni-rich layered oxide (NRLO) cathodes are one of the most promising cathode candidates for the next high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. However, they face structure and interface instability challenges, especially the battery safety risk caused by using an intrinsic flammable organic liquid electrolyte. In this regard, a solid electrolyte with high safety is of great significance to promote the development of energy storage. Among them, sulfide electrolytes are considered to be the most potential substitutes for liquid electrolytes because of their high ionic conductivity and good processing properties. Nevertheless, the interfacial incompatibility between the sulfide electrolyte and NRLO cathode is the critical challenge for high-performance sulfide all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). In this review, we summarize the problems of the Ni-rich cathode/sulfide solid electrolyte interface and the strategies to improve the interface stability. On the basis of these insights, we highlight the scientific problems and technological challenges that need to be resolved urgently and propose several potential directions to further improve the interface stability. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding and insightful recommendations for the enhancement of the sulfide ASSLBs with NRLO cathode.
