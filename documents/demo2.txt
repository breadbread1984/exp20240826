Mg metal has a low redox potential (-2.37 versus SHE) and offers a higher volumetric ca- pacity (3834 mA h cm−3) compared to Li (2063 mA h cm−3), making it a promising anode material for post-lithium energy storage. Notably, electrolytes such as hexamethyldisilazide magnesium chloride, MACC (magne- sium aluminate chloride complex), and Mg(TFSI)2–MgCl2 (TFSI-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) are less reactive and demonstrated improved oxidative stability, but fell short of delivering targeted coulombic efficiencies above 99.0%.
