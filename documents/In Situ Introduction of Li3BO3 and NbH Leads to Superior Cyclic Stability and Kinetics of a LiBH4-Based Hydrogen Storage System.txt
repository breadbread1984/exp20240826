LiBH4 is a high-capacity hydrogen storage material; however, it suffers from high dehydrogenation temperature and poor reversibility. To tackle those issues, we introduce a new LiBH4 -based system with in situ formed superfine and well-dispersed Li3BO3 and NbH as co-reactants. Those are synthesized by the addition of niobium ethoxide [Nb(OEt)5] to LiBH4, heat treatment of the mixture, and then hydrogenation, where Li3BO3 and NbH are generated from the reaction of Nb(OEt)5 and LiBH4. After optimization, the system with a normalized composition of LiBH4 -0.04( Li3BO3 + NbH) in molar fraction shows superior hydrogen storage reversibility and kinetics. The initial and main dehydrogenation temperatures of the system are 200 and 90 째C lower than those of the pristine LiBH4 , respectively, and 8.2 wt % H2 is released upon heating to 400 째C. A capacity of 7.2 wt % H2, corresponding to a capacity retention of 91%, is sustained after 30 cycles in an isothermal cyclic regime of dwelling at 400 째C for 60 min for dehydrogenation and dwelling at 500 째C and 50 bar H2 pressure for 20 min for hydrogenation. Such a high cyclic stability for a LiBH4-based system has never been reported to date. The in situ introduced Li3BO3 and NbH have a synergistic catalysis effect on the improvement of the hydrogen storage performance of LiBH4, showing highly effective bidirectional action on both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation.
